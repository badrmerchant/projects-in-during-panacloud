HTML5 Showcase
==============
hello

Using AngularJS, D3.js, Three.js, WebRTC, Socket.IO, Node.js, and MongoDB
--------------

HTML5 has extremely powerful features and API's.
A lot of developers the world over are developing very compelling apps using some of these capabilities. 
However, the main power comes from using these capabilities together in a synergistic way. 
The power of client side database, offline, real-time and peer-to-peer  capabilities combined with scalable vector and 3D graphics allows us to create compelling user experiences.
The recent crop of MVC frameworks allows us to develop code that is maintainable and testable both on the client as well as the server.
If you combine this HTML5 magnificence with the power and scalability of the cloud (PaaS) you indeed have a revolution at your hands.  
A new software development stack is emerging, which has made JavaScript a full stack language:

- AngularJS Framework for MVC Architecture.
- D3.js for Scalable Vector Graphics and Data Visualization.
- Three.js for 3D Graphics.
- Socket.IO and WebRTC for real-time communication.
- PouchDB for client data management.
- Node.js to build scalable network (especially server-side) and cloud applications (ASP.NET MVC, Java PHP versions are also under development for details see below).
- MongoDB for scalable data management (SQL Server, MySQL, and Oracle versions also under development).

Basically it extends the MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and Node.js) Stack with D3, Three.js, Socket.IO and PouchDB‏

 
The HTML5 Showcase is a demonstration for developers of how to use these features seamlessly and how this extended stack can be used to
develop applications.


**Platforms it can run on:**

- Web App on any Modern Browser
- Windows 8.1 Store App
- Chrome Desktop App
- Android and iOS App using PhoneGap *(WebGL and WebRTC not supported yet)*

In this architecture the Node.js/MongoDB server code can be easily replaced with ASP.NET MVC/SQL Server on Windows Azure, Java EE with MySQL, and PHP with MySQL. These three versions are currently under development.

There is tremendous interest in these technologies. I have been teaching them in universities, even in a auditorium with a capacity of 350, [students are willing to sit on the floor to learn](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151345891287623.1073741825.692297622&type=1&l=d88a96a2c5).
We announced free classes for these technologies on the social media and [over 1,000 students showed up to take the admission tests](http://epaper.jehanpakistan.com/E-Paper/khi/190813/openlink.asp?ddir=190813&im=p6-17.jpg).
Developers and students all over world love these technologies. Soon we are planning to start these courses on a global scale (technology under development). The idea is to teach the under-privileged youth of the world and make them productive citizens.

Note: I have not used RequireJS in this project because I am also using it as a teaching tool in my classes. My experience is that RequireJS makes it difficult for the students to follow and play with the code.
